Transaction management ensures that the database remains in a consistent (cor- rect) state despite system failures. The transaction manager ensures that concur- rent transaction executions proceed without con\ufb02icts. The architecture of a database system is greatly in\ufb02uenced by the underlying com- puter system on which the database system runs. Database systems can be central- ized, or parallel, involving multiple machines. Distributed databases span multiple geographically separated machines. Database applications are typically broken up into a front-end part that runs at client machines and a part that runs at the backend. In two-tier architectures, the front end directly communicates with a database running at the back end. In three- tier architectures, the back end part is itself broken up into an application server and a database server. There are four di\ufb00erent types of database-system users, di\ufb00erentiated by the way they expect to interact with the system. Di\ufb00erent types of user interfaces have been designed for the di\ufb00erent types of users. Data-analysis techniques attempt to automatically discover rules and patterns from data. The \ufb01eld of data mining combines knowledge-discovery techniques invented by arti\ufb01cial intelligence researchers and statistical analysts with e\ufb03cient imple- mentation techniques that enable them to be used on extremely large databases.

What are two disadvantages? 2List \ufb01ve ways in which the type declaration system of a language such as Java or C++ di\ufb00ers from the data de\ufb01nition language used in a database. 3 List six major steps that you would take in setting up a database for a particular enterprise. 4Suppose you want to build a video site similar to YouTube. Consider each of the points listed in Section - 2 as disadvantages of keeping data in a \ufb01le-processing system. Discuss the relevance of each of these points to the storage of actual video data, and to metadata about the video, such as title, the user who uploaded it, tags, and which users viewed it. 5Keyword queries used in web search are quite di\ufb00erent from database queries. List key di\ufb00erences between the two, in terms of the way the queries are speci\ufb01ed and in terms of what is the result of a query. List four applications you have used that most likely employed a database system to store persistent data. 7List four signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between a \ufb01le-processing system and a DBMS. 8Explain the concept of physical data independence and its importance in database systems. 9List \ufb01ve responsibilities of a database-management system. For each responsi- bility, explain the problems that would arise if the responsibility were not dis- charged. 10List at least two reasons why database systems support data manipulation using a declarative query language such as SQL, instead of just providing a library of C or C++ functions to carry out data manipulation. 11Assume that two students are trying to register for a course in which there is only one open seat. What component of a database system prevents both students from being given that last seat? 12Explain the di\ufb00erence between two-tier and three-tier application architectures. Which is better suited for web applications? Why? 13List two features developed in the 2000s and that help database systems handle data-analytics workloads. 14Explain why NoSQL systems emerged in the 2000s, and brie\ufb02y contrast their features with traditional database systems. 15Describe at least three tables that might be used to store information in a social- networking system such as Facebook.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"week1/textbook/","text":"","title":"Textbook"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Model1_annotated/","text":"Lecture 2.1 - Introduction to Relational Model1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)","title":"Lecture 2.1 - Introduction to Relational Model1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Model1_annotated/#lecture-21-introduction-to-relational-model1_annotatedpdf-pdf-file","text":"","title":"Lecture 2.1 - Introduction to Relational Model1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.2%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Model2_annotated/","text":"Lecture 2.2 - Introduction to Relational Model2_annotated.pdf (PDF file)","title":"Lecture 2.2 - Introduction to Relational Model2_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.2%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Relational%20Model2_annotated/#lecture-22-introduction-to-relational-model2_annotatedpdf-pdf-file","text":"","title":"Lecture 2.2 - Introduction to Relational Model2_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.3%20-%20Introduction%20to%20SQL1_annotated/","text":"Lecture 2.3 - Introduction to SQL1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)","title":"Lecture 2.3 - Introduction to SQL1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.3%20-%20Introduction%20to%20SQL1_annotated/#lecture-23-introduction-to-sql1_annotatedpdf-pdf-file","text":"","title":"Lecture 2.3 - Introduction to SQL1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.4%20-%20Introduction%20to%20SQL2_annotated/","text":"Lecture 2.4 - Introduction to SQL2_annotated.pdf (PDF file)","title":"Lecture 2.4 - Introduction to SQL2_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/Lecture%202.4%20-%20Introduction%20to%20SQL2_annotated/#lecture-24-introduction-to-sql2_annotatedpdf-pdf-file","text":"","title":"Lecture 2.4 - Introduction to SQL2_annotated.pdf (PDF file)"},{"location":"week2/check_list/","text":"[ ] Text Book [ ] slides [ ] weekly assigment [ ] lecture [ ] live session [ ] text book activity","title":"Check list"}]}
