This module focuses on nested subqueries in SQL and data modification. Nested subqueries are select-from-where expressions embedded within other queries. They can be used for set membership, set comparisons, and set cardinality tests. Data modification involves deleting, inserting, and updating tuples in database tables. Deletion can be done using the DELETE statement, insertion using the INSERT statement, and updates using the UPDATE statement. The CASE statement can be used for conditional updates. Scalar subqueries can be used to update column values based on computations involving other tables.# Lecture 3.2 - Intermediate SQL1_annotated.pdf (PDF file)
