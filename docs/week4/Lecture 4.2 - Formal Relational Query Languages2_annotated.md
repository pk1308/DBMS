**Summary**
This module covers formal calculus-based query languages, including the study of relational algebra, tuple relational calculus, and domain relational calculus. Predicate logic is introduced as the foundation for these calculus-based query languages.

Key concepts include:

* **Predicate Logic:**
    * A way of expressing statements that cannot be adequately represented by propositional logic.
    * Uses predicates and quantifiers to describe properties and relationships between objects.

* **Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC):**
    * A non-procedural query language where queries are expressed as sets of tuples satisfying certain conditions.
    * Uses quantifiers and predicates to define the desired tuples.

* **Domain Relational Calculus (DRC):**
    * Equivalent in power to TRC, but uses domain variables instead of tuples.
    * Formulas in DRC resemble predicate calculus formulas.

The text also establishes the equivalence of relational algebra, TRC, and DRC, highlighting their equal expressive power. The concept of safe expressions is introduced to prevent infinite relations from being generated in TRC and DRC expressions.
