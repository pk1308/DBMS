**Summary**
**Database Design Process:**

- Requirement Analysis: Define data needs and business requirements
- Database Designing: Create an abstraction using a modeling framework
  - Logical Model: Determine database schema
  - Physical Model: Plan database layout

**Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:**

- Represents an enterprise as a collection of entities, attributes, and relationships
- Attributes: Properties of entities
- Entity Sets: Collections of entities of the same type
- Relationships: Associations among multiple entities

**Entity Sets:**

- Entities are objects distinguishable from others (e.g., person, company)
- Entity sets contain entities with shared properties
- Primary keys uniquely identify members of an entity set

**Relationships:**

- Associations between entities (e.g., student-advisor relationship)
- Relationship sets define mathematical relations between multiple entities

**Mapping Cardinality Constraints:**

- Expresses the number of entities that can be associated via a relationship
- Types:
  - One to one
  - One to many
  - Many to one
  - Many to many

**Weak Entity Sets:**

- Entity sets that lack sufficient attributes for unique identification
- Dependent on strong entity sets through an identifying relationship
- Primary key of weak entity set = Discriminator + Primary Key of strong entity set
