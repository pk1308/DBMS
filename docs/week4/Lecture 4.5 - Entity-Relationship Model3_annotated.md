**Summary**
**Extended Features of the Entity-Relationship Model**

- Non-binary relationships: These relationships involve more than two entities.
- Specialization: A sub-group of entities within an entity set is designated with distinctive characteristics. These sub-groups become lower-level entity sets that inherit attributes and relationships from the higher-level entity set.
- Generalization: Combining a number of entity sets with shared features into a higher-level entity set.
- Aggregation: Treating a relationship set as an abstract entity, allowing for relationships between relationships.

**Design Issues**

- Entities vs. Attributes: Deciding whether to represent an object as an entity or an attribute.
- Entities vs. Relationship Sets: Distinguishing between real-world concepts that are best expressed by entities or relationships.
- Binary vs. Non-Binary Relationships: Determining whether to use binary or non-binary relationships to represent a relationship.
- Strong vs. Weak Entity Sets: Strong entity sets have an independent existence, while weak entity sets exist only in conjunction with another entity set.
- Specialization/Generalization: Using specialization to divide an entity set into sub-groups or generalization to combine entity sets with shared features.
- Aggregation: Treating an aggregate entity set as a unit without considering its internal structure.

**ER Notation**

- Symbols for representing entities, relationships, and attributes in an ER diagram.
- Diagrams provide a graphical representation of the relationships and constraints between entities in a database.
