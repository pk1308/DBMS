**Summary**
Module 16 of Database Management Systems focuses on formal relational query languages like relational algebra. Relational algebra is an algebra-based language for querying relational databases. It has six basic operators:

1. Select (σ): Filters rows based on a condition.
2. Project (Π): Selects specific columns.
3. Union (∪): Combines rows from two compatible relations.
4. Difference (-): Removes rows that are in the second relation but not the first.
5. Intersection (∩): Finds rows that are common to both relations.
6. Cartesian Product (x): Combines all rows from one relation with all rows from another.

These operators can be used in combination to create complex queries. Additionally, relational algebra includes a rename operation (ρ) and a division operation (÷), which is a derived operation.

The basic operations and examples of division are explained in detail. The module provides a thorough understanding of relational algebra and its use in formal relational query languages.
