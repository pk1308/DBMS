**Given Relation and Functional Dependencies:**

1. - Relation: \( R(K, J, L, O, M, N) \)
   - Functional Dependencies:
     - \( K $\rightarrow$ J, L )
     - \( L $\rightarrow$ K )
     - \(  J $\rightarrow$ O, \)
     - \( M $\rightarrow$ N \)
2. **Steps to Find Candidate Keys:**

   - Identify attributes not present on the right-hand side (RHS) of any functional dependency.
   - These attributes must be part of the candidate key.
3. **Attributes Analysis:**

   - \( M, K \) and \( M, L \) are identified as potential candidate keys.
   - The closure of these sets is calculated to verify if they can determine all attributes in \( R \).
4. **Prime and Non-Prime Attributes:**

   - Prime attributes (part of candidate keys): \( M, K, L \)
   - Non-prime attributes (not part of candidate keys): \( J, N, O \)
5. **Closure Calculations:**

   - \( (M)^+ = \{M, N\} \)
   - \( (MJ)^+ = \{M, J, N, O\} \)
   - \( (MK)^+ = \{M, K, N, J, L, O\} = R \) (Candidate Key)
   - \( (ML)^+ = \{M, L, N, K, J, O\} = R \) (Candidate Key)
   - \( (MN)^+ = \{M, N\} \)
   - \( (MO)^+ = \{M, O, N\} \)
6. **Conclusion:**

   - The candidate keys for the relation \( R \) are \( MK \) and \( ML \).




### Problem Statement

- **Relation R**: Has eight attributes \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \).
- **Functional Dependencies (FDs)**:
  - \( CH $\rightarrow$ G \)
  - \( A $\rightarrow$ BC \)
  - \( B $\rightarrow$ CFH \)
  - \( E $\rightarrow$ A \)
  - \( F $\rightarrow$ EG \)

### Objective

Determine how many candidate keys the relation \( R \) has.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Identify the Closure of Attributes**:

   - The closure of an attribute set \( X \) (denoted as \( X^+ \)) is the set of attributes that can be functionally determined by \( X \).
2. **Determine the Candidate Keys**:

   - A candidate key is a minimal set of attributes that can determine all other attributes in the relation.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Compute Closures**:

   - **Closure of \( DA \)**:
     - \( DA^+ = \{D, A, B, C, F, H, E, G\} \) (from \( A $\rightarrow$ BC \), \( B $\rightarrow$ CFH \), \( F $\rightarrow$ EG \), and \( E $\rightarrow$ A \))
   - **Closure of \( DB \)**:
     - \( DB^+ = \{D, B, C, F, H, E, G, A\} \) (from \( B $\rightarrow$ CFH \), \( F $\rightarrow$ EG \), and \( E $\rightarrow$ A \))
   - **Closure of \( DC \)**:
     - \( DC^+ = \{D, C, G\} \) (from \( CH $\rightarrow$ G \))
   - **Closure of \( DE \)**:
     - \( DE^+ = \{D, E, A, B, C, F, H, G\} \) (from \( E $\rightarrow$ A \), \( A $\rightarrow$ BC \), \( B $\rightarrow$ CFH \), and \( F $\rightarrow$ EG \))
   - **Closure of \( DF \)**:
     - \( DF^+ = \{D, F, E, G, A, B, C, H\} \) (from \( F $\rightarrow$ EG \), \( E $\rightarrow$ A \), \( A $\rightarrow$ BC \), and \( B $\rightarrow$ CFH \))
   - **Closure of \( DG \)**:
     - \( DG^+ = \{D, G\} \)
   - **Closure of \( DH \)**:
     - \( DH^+ = \{D, H, G\} \) (from \( CH $\rightarrow$ G \))
2. **Check for Superkeys**:

   - A superkey is a set of attributes that can determine all attributes in the relation.
   - From the closures computed, we see that \( DA^+ \), \( DB^+ \), \( DE^+ \), and \( DF^+ \) include all attributes \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \). Therefore, \( DA \), \( DB \), \( DE \), and \( DF \) are superkeys.
3. **Minimal Superkeys (Candidate Keys)**:

   - To find candidate keys, we need to check minimal superkeys.
   - From the given FDs, we can infer that:
     - \( DA \), \( DB \), \( DE \), and \( DF \) are candidate keys because their closures include all attributes and they are minimal.

### Conclusion

- The relation \( R \) has **four candidate keys**, which are \( DA \), \( DB \), \( DE \), and \( DF \).

Thus, the relation \( R \) has exactly **four candidate keys**.
