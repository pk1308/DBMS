| Rectangle              | Entity                      | A rectangle with the entity name inside it.                               | Represents an entity, which is a distinct object in the system with a unique identity.                        |
| Ellipse                | Attribute                   | An ellipse with the attribute name inside it.                             | Represents an attribute, which is a property or characteristic of an entity.                                  |
| Double Ellipse         | Multivalued Attribute       | An ellipse with a double border and the attribute name inside it.         | Represents an attribute that can have multiple values for a single entity.                                    |
| Dashed Ellipse         | Derived Attribute           | An ellipse with a dashed border and the attribute name inside it.         | Represents an attribute whose value can be derived from other attributes.                                     |
| Diamond                | Relationship                | A diamond shape with the relationship name inside it.                     | Represents a relationship, which is an association among two or more entities.                                |
| Double Rectangle       | Weak Entity                 | A rectangle with a double border and the entity name inside it.           | Represents a weak entity, which depends on another entity (its identifying owner) for its existence.          |
| Double Diamond         | Identifying Relationship    | A diamond shape with a double border and the relationship name inside it. | Represents a relationship that links a weak entity to its identifying owner.                                  |
| Line                   | Connector                   | A simple line connecting shapes.                                          | Connects entities to relationships and attributes to entities or relationships.                               |
| Double Line            | Total Participation         | A line connecting shapes with a double border.                            | Indicates that every instance of the entity must participate in at least one instance of the relationship.    |
| Dashed Line            | Partial Participation       | A line with a dashed border connecting shapes.                            | Indicates that not every instance of the entity must participate in the relationship.                         |
| Primary Key (PK)       | Underlined Attribute        | An attribute name with an underline.                                      | Represents an attribute that uniquely identifies each entity instance.                                        |
| Foreign Key (FK)       | Dashed Underlined Attribute | An attribute name with a dashed underline.                                | Represents an attribute that is a primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between entities. |
