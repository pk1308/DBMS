# Web Fundamentals

**Summary**

**Web Fundamentals**

The World Wide Web, a distributed information system built upon the foundation of hypertext, takes center stage. Hypertext documents, primarily formatted using the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), serve as the building blocks of the web. HTML empowers developers to structure content, specify font styles and formatting instructions, embed hypertext links connecting to other documents, and design forms enabling user input, which can be transmitted back to the web server for processing.

Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) provide a standardized mechanism for locating resources on the web. A URL comprises several components: the protocol used to access the document (e.g., HTTP), the domain name of the web server hosting the document, and the path to the specific resource on the server. URLs can be further categorized as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or Uniform Resource Names (URNs), with URIs encompassing both locators (URLs) and names (URNs).

HTML and HTTP, two cornerstone technologies of the web, are then brought into focus. HTML provides the structural foundation for web pages, enabling the inclusion of text, multimedia elements, hyperlinks, and forms. HTTP, on the other hand, serves as the communication protocol between web browsers and web servers, facilitating the exchange of requests and responses.

The concept of sessions and cookies is introduced to address the stateless nature of the HTTP protocol. Cookies, small text files stored on the user's computer by the web server, enable the persistence of information across multiple interactions with a website. This mechanism is commonly employed for user authentication, session management, and personalization.

Web browsers, the user's gateway to the World Wide Web, are software applications designed to retrieve, interpret, and display web pages. They handle the rendering of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, providing an interactive and visually appealing representation of web content. Web servers, on the other hand, are responsible for storing, processing, and delivering web pages and other resources in response to requests from web browsers.

Web services, a key enabler of distributed computing, allow applications to communicate and exchange data over a network, typically using the HTTP protocol and XML or JSON as data formats.

**Scripting for Web Applications**

Scripting, a programming paradigm that involves embedding executable code within a web page or on the server, is introduced as a powerful technique for enhancing the functionality and interactivity of web applications. Scripts can be executed on the client-side (by the user's web browser) or on the server-side (by the web server).

Client-side scripting, often implemented using JavaScript, focuses on enhancing the user interface and providing dynamic interactions within the web browser. JavaScript code can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, validate user input, make asynchronous requests to the web server, and create rich, interactive elements.

Server-side scripting, on the other hand, involves executing code on the web server before sending the response back to the client. This paradigm is commonly used for tasks such as database interaction, business logic processing, and dynamic content generation. Popular server-side scripting languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java Servlets.

**Servlets**

Servlets, Java programs that run within a web server environment, provide a robust and scalable framework for building server-side web applications. They handle client requests, process data, interact with databases, and generate dynamic responses. The Java Servlet API defines a set of interfaces and classes that facilitate communication between servlets and the web server.

**JavaServer Pages (JSP)**

JavaServer Pages (JSP) provide a simplified approach to creating dynamic web pages by embedding Java code within HTML markup. JSP pages are compiled into servlets by the web server, enabling developers to leverage the power and portability of the Java platform for web development.

**PHP**

PHP, a widely-used server-side scripting language, is highlighted for its ease of use, extensive library support, and strong database connectivity features. PHP code can be embedded within HTML markup, allowing for the creation of dynamic web pages with minimal effort.

The lecture concludes by reiterating the key takeaways, emphasizing the fundamental concepts of web technologies, scripting, and servlets. It underscores the importance of understanding these technologies for building robust, scalable, and interactive web applications.
