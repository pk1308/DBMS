**Summary**
**Recovery with Early Lock Release**

**Concept**

* Early lock release techniques enable database systems to increase concurrency by releasing locks on index structures (e.g., B+-trees) before a transaction completes.
* This can lead to situations where a value in a B+-tree node has been updated by an incomplete transaction and may be overwritten by another transaction.

**Logical Undo Logging**

* To address this issue, "logical undo" is implemented.
* Instead of overwriting the original value with the new value, an undo operation is recorded in the log.
* This ensures that if the incomplete transaction needs to be rolled back, the undo operation can restore the original value.
* For example, the deletion of an entry in a B+-tree can be recorded as a logical undo operation, allowing for early lock release.

**Physical Redo**

* Physical redo logging is still used to record physical changes to the database.
* This information is used for recovery after a system crash, regardless of whether logical undo was used.

**Operation Logging Process**

* When a transaction starts, an operation-begin log record is generated with a unique identifier for the operation.
* During execution, update log records are created with the usual old-value (physical undo) and new-value (physical redo) information.
* When the operation completes, an operation-end log record is created, containing information for performing a logical undo.

**Transaction Rollback with Logical Undo**

* Transaction rollback with logical undo involves scanning the log backwards.
* If an update log record is encountered, the physical undo information is used to revert the change.
* If a operation-end log record is found, logical undo is performed using the information provided.
* The transaction's log records are skipped until the operation-begin log record is reached.

**Failure Recovery with Logical Undo**

* Recovery after a system crash involves two phases: redo and undo.
* The redo phase scans the log forward from the last checkpoint, repeating history by redoing all updates.
* An undo-list is maintained, containing incomplete transactions.
* The undo phase scans the log backwards, performing logical undo on records of transactions in the undo-list.
* When the start records of all incomplete transactions have been processed, recovery is complete.

**Plan for Backup and Recovery**

* Developing a plan for backup and recovery involves considering factors such as:
    * Data importance and criticality
    * Frequency of database changes
    * Recovery speed and available resources
    * Equipment and infrastructure
    * Responsible team and backup storage options
