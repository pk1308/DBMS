**Summary**
This module introduces the relational model for database management systems. It covers:

**Attributes and Types:**
* Attributes represent data characteristics and have specific types, such as alphanumeric strings, dates, or numbers.

**Schema and Instance:**
* Schema defines the structure of a relation (table) specifying attributes and their types.
* Instance is the current state of a relation, represented as a table with rows (tuples).

**Keys:**
* A superkey uniquely identifies tuples in a relation.
* A candidate key is a minimal superkey.
* A primary key is the selected candidate key used for unique identification.

**Relational Query Languages:**
* Relational algebra, a procedural language, is introduced as a tool for manipulating relations using basic operations.
* Other "pure" languages exist but are not covered here.
