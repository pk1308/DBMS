**Summary**
## Additional Basic Operations

### Cartesian Product

- Finds all possible combinations of tuples from two or more relations.
- Useful when selecting data based on relationships between tables.
- Example: Select all possible instructor-course pairs using Cartesian product:
```sql
select *
from instructor, teaches
```

### Rename AS Operation

- Allows renaming of relations and attributes using the `as` clause:
```sql
old name as new name
```
- Optional keyword `as` may be omitted.

### String Values

- SQL includes a string-matching operator (`like`) for character string comparisons.
- Uses special characters:
    - Percent (%) matches any substring
    - Underscore (_) matches any character
- Example: Find instructors with "dar" in their name:
```sql
select name
from instructor
where name like '%dar%'
```

### Order By Clause

- Orders the display of tuples in ascending or descending order.
- By default, it is in ascending order.
- Can order by multiple attributes.
- Example: Order by name in descending order:
```sql
select distinct name
from instructor
order by name desc
```

### Select Top / Fetch Clause

- Limits the number of records returned in the output.
- Useful for large tables to avoid performance impact.
- Example: Select the top 10 distinct names from the instructor table:
```sql
select top 10 distinct name
from instructor
```

### Where Clause Predicates

- Allows selecting tuples that meet specified conditions.
- Uses comparison operators, logical operators, and functions.
- Between operator allows specifying a range of values.
- Example: Find instructors with salaries between $90,000 and $100,000:
```sql
select name
from instructor
where salary between 90000 and 100000
```

### In Operator

- Allows specifying multiple values in a where clause.
- Shorthand for multiple `or` conditions.
- Example: Find instructors in the 'Comp. Sci.' or 'Biology' departments:
```sql
select name
from instructor
where dept name in ('Comp. Sci.', 'Biology')
```

### Duplicates

- SQL handles duplicates based on multiset semantics.
- Number of copies of tuples in the result depends on the number of copies in the input relations.
- For example, if there are two copies of tuple (1, a) in r1 and three copies of tuple (2) in r2, then the expression:
```sql
Î B (r1) x r2
```
would result in six copies of tuple (a, 2).
