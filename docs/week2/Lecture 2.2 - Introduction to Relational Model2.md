**Summary**
Module 7 of Database Management Systems introduces the relational model for data representation and manipulation. It covers relational operators, such as select, project, union, difference, intersection, Cartesian product, and natural join, which allow for the retrieval, combination, and transformation of data in relations. Additionally, aggregation operators, including sum, average, maximum, and minimum, are introduced for performing aggregate calculations. The module emphasizes the properties and limitations of relational languages, including their set-based nature, non-Turing completeness, and the requirement for all data to be present in input tables for output generation.
