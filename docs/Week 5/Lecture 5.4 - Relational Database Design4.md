**Summary**
This module covers algorithms and properties related to functional dependencies (FDs).

**Attribute Set Closure:**
- Algorithm to find the closure of an attribute set, which includes the set itself and all attributes implied by FDs.
- Used to test if an attribute set is a superkey or to test functional dependencies.

**Extraneous Attributes:**
- Algorithms to identify and remove extraneous attributes, which are redundant in FDs.
- Helps optimize the set of FDs by eliminating unnecessary dependencies.

**Equivalence of FD Sets:**
- Two sets of FDs are equivalent if they logically imply each other's dependencies.
- Useful for comparing different representations of functional dependencies.

**Canonical Cover:**
- Algorithm to find a minimal and unique set of FDs that represent a given set of FDs.
- Ensures that there are no redundant or extraneous dependencies.
- The canonical cover is often used as a "normalized" representation of functional dependencies.

**Practice Problems:**
- Exercises to test understanding of the algorithms and concepts discussed.
- Cover tasks like checking FD implications, finding super and candidate keys, and computing canonical covers.
