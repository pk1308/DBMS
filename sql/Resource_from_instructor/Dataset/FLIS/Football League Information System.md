The Football League Information System (FLIS) is a relational database schema that manages information about a football league season, including teams, players, managers, matches, scores, and referees.

Key characteristics of FLIS include:

* Teams have unique IDs, names, locations, playgrounds, and jersey colors.
* Players have unique IDs, names, dates of birth, jersey numbers, and belong to only one team.
* Managers are associated with only one team and have unique IDs, names, dates of birth, and years of management.
* Matches are played between two teams on the host team's playground and have scores and unique numbers. Each match has four referees in specific roles.
* Players cannot play for multiple teams, managers cannot be associated with multiple teams, and only one match occurs per day.# Football League Information System.pdf (PDF file)
